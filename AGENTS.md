## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
**Required tools for ISO builds:**

```bash
# Install Just command runner (REQUIRED for local ISO builds)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/.local/bin
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Verify container runtime (REQUIRED for local ISO builds)
podman --version || docker --version

# Install pre-commit for validation
pip install pre-commit
```

**Note**: Local ISO builds are resource-intensive. Most development work can be tested via GitHub Actions workflows.

### Essential Commands

**Validation (ALWAYS run before committing changes):**
```bash
# 1. Validate syntax and formatting
pre-commit run --all-files

# 2. Check Just syntax (if Just is installed)
just check

# 3. Fix formatting issues automatically
just fix
```

**Local ISO builds (requires significant resources):**
```bash
# Build ISO from local container image
just build-iso bluefin gts main

# Build ISO from GHCR (recommended for testing)
just build-iso-ghcr bluefin stable main

# Run ISO in VM for testing
just run-iso bluefin gts main
```

**Utility commands:**
```bash
# Clean build artifacts
just clean

# List all available recipes
just --list

# Validate image/tag/flavor combinations
just validate bluefin gts main
```

### Critical ISO Build Notes

1. **ISO builds are EXTREMELY resource-intensive**:
   - Requires 50GB+ free disk space
   - Takes 30-60 minutes per ISO
   - Requires privileged container access
   - Better to test via GitHub Actions workflows

2. **Validation is mandatory**:
   - Always run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing
   - Check Just syntax with `just check`
   - Validate flatpak lists via workflow

3. **Testing workflow changes**:
   - Use workflow dispatch for manual testing
   - Test in your fork first before opening PR
   - Monitor runner time and storage usage

4. **Flatpak validation**:
   - GitHub Actions automatically validates flatpak IDs
   - Ensure flatpaks exist on Flathub before adding

### Common Build Failures & Workarounds

**Pre-commit failures:**
```bash
# Fix end-of-file and trailing whitespace automatically
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Just syntax errors:**
```bash
# Auto-fix formatting
just fix

# Manual validation
just check
```

**ISO build failures:**
- Ensure adequate disk space (50GB+ free)
- Clean previous builds: `just clean`
- Check container runtime: `podman system info`
- Verify base image exists and is pullable
- Check hook scripts for syntax errors

## Validation Pipeline

### Pre-commit Hooks (REQUIRED)
The repository uses mandatory pre-commit validation:
- `check-json` - Validates JSON syntax
- `check-toml` - Validates TOML syntax
- `check-yaml` - Validates YAML syntax (includes workflow files)
- `end-of-file-fixer` - Ensures files end with newline
- `trailing-whitespace` - Removes trailing whitespace

**Always run:** `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing changes.

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `build-iso-lts.yml` - Builds LTS ISO images (calls reusable workflow)
- `reusable-build-iso-anaconda.yml` - Core ISO build logic with matrix strategy
  - Builds multiple platform/flavor/version combinations
  - Uses Titanoboa for ISO generation
  - Uploads to CloudFlare R2 or GitHub artifacts
- `validate-flatpaks.yml` - Validates flatpak list files against Flathub

**Workflow Architecture:**
- LTS workflow calls reusable workflow with specific variants
- Reusable workflow uses matrix strategy for parallel builds
- Supports workflow dispatch for manual builds
- Automatically builds on ISO configuration changes

### Manual Validation Steps
1. `pre-commit run --all-files` - Runs validation hooks
2. `just check` - Validates Just syntax (if Just is installed)
3. `just fix` - Auto-fixes formatting issues (if Just is installed)
4. Test via workflow dispatch rather than local builds when possible

## ISO Configuration

### ISO Configuration Scripts
Located in `iso_files/`, these scripts customize the live environment and Anaconda installer:

**`configure_iso_anaconda.sh`** (for GTS, Stable, Latest, Beta):
- Removes unnecessary packages from live CD
- Configures GNOME dock with installer shortcuts
- Disables sleep/suspend during installation
- Installs Anaconda and WebUI (for F42+)
- Creates Anaconda profile for Bluefin
- Configures automatic Flatpak installation
- Sets up secure boot key enrollment
- Customizes branding and artwork

**`configure_lts_iso_anaconda.sh`** (for LTS variants):
- Similar to standard configuration
- Uses CentOS-specific settings
- Different filesystem defaults (XFS instead of BTRFS)
- Modified partitioning scheme
- Different bootloader configuration

Key configuration differences:
- **Standard**: BTRFS filesystem, Fedora repos, secure boot enrollment
- **LTS**: XFS filesystem, CentOS repos, no secure boot (commented out)

### Flatpak Management
Flatpaks are pre-installed on the ISO for offline installation:

**`system-flatpaks.list`** - Core applications:
- Firefox, GNOME apps, utilities
- Included on all ISOs

**`system-flatpaks-dx.list`** - Developer tools:
- IDEs, development utilities
- Only included on DX variant ISOs

**`system-flatpaks-extra.list`** - Optional applications:
- Additional software
- Currently not used in ISO builds

**Adding Flatpaks:**
1. Add flatpak ID to appropriate list file (one per line)
2. Add comments with `#` for documentation
3. Run validation: GitHub Actions will check against Flathub
4. For LTS ISOs, Bazaar is automatically added by workflow

### Justfile ISO Recipes
The `Justfile` contains recipes for building ISOs (copied from main Bluefin repo):

**Key ISO recipes:**
- `build-iso [image] [tag] [flavor] [ghcr] [pipeline]` - Main ISO build command
- `build-iso-ghcr [image] [tag] [flavor]` - Build ISO from GHCR image
- `run-iso [image] [tag] [flavor]` - Test ISO in VM
- `validate [image] [tag] [flavor]` - Validate image/tag/flavor combination
- `image_name [image] [tag] [flavor]` - Get full image name
- `fedora_version [image] [tag] [flavor]` - Get Fedora version for image

**Note**: Most ISO recipes are for local development. GitHub Actions handles production builds.

## Configuration Files

### Key Configuration Locations
- `iso_files/` - ISO configuration and hook scripts
- `flatpaks/` - Flatpak application lists
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions
- `just/` - Additional Just recipes (from main Bluefin repo)
- `Justfile` - Main build recipes (from main Bluefin repo)

### Linting/Build Configurations
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hook configuration
- `Justfile` - ISO build recipe definitions
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns for build artifacts

## Workflow Deep Dive

### Reusable ISO Build Workflow
The `reusable-build-iso-anaconda.yml` is the core workflow:

**Trigger conditions:**
- Workflow dispatch (manual) - choose variant to build
- Pull requests - on ISO configuration changes
- Workflow call - from other workflows (e.g., LTS)

**Build matrix:**
Dynamically generates matrix based on input:
- **Platforms**: amd64 (x86_64), arm64 (aarch64)
- **Flavors**: main, nvidia-open, gdx
- **Variants**: gts, stable, latest, beta, lts, lts-hwe

**Build process:**
1. Determine matrix based on variant selection
2. Setup build environment (maximize disk space)
3. Checkout repository and setup Just
4. Format image reference and determine kernel args
5. Add Bazaar to LTS flatpaks (if LTS variant)
6. Build ISO using Titanoboa action
7. Rename and checksum ISO
8. Upload to CloudFlare R2 or GitHub artifacts

**Key workflow features:**
- Parallel builds across matrix
- Separate runners for arm64 vs amd64
- Conditional Bazaar addition for LTS
- Different builder distro for LTS (centos) vs others (fedora)
- Conditional uploads based on event type

### LTS Workflow
The `build-iso-lts.yml` is a simple caller:
- Triggers on workflow dispatch or workflow call
- Calls reusable workflow with LTS-specific parameters
- Builds both main and gdx flavors for LTS

## Justfile Structure
The `Justfile` contains build automation (copied from main Bluefin):

**Key variables:**
- `repo_organization` - GitHub organization
- `images` - Image name mappings
- `flavors` - Flavor mappings (main, nvidia-open, gdx)
- `tags` - Tag/variant mappings (gts, stable, latest, beta, lts, lts-hwe)

**ISO-related recipes:**
- `build-iso` - Build ISO from local or GHCR image
- `build-iso-ghcr` - Wrapper for GHCR builds
- `run-iso` - Test ISO in VM
- Helper recipes for image name formatting and validation

**Note**: The Justfile is comprehensive and includes recipes from the main Bluefin repository. Not all recipes are relevant for ISO-only builds.

## Development Guidelines

### Making Changes
1. **ALWAYS validate first:** `pre-commit run --all-files && just check`
2. **Make minimal modifications** - focus on ISO configuration
3. **Test via workflow dispatch** rather than local builds when possible
4. **Focus on ISO configuration files** - `iso_files/` and `flatpaks/`
5. **Update documentation** if changing build process

### File Editing Best Practices
- **YAML workflow files**: Validate syntax with `pre-commit run check-yaml`
- **Flatpak lists**: Run validation via GitHub Actions workflow
- **Justfile**: Always run `just check` after modifications (if Just installed)
- **Shell scripts**: Follow existing patterns in `iso_files/`
- **Bash scripts**: Validate syntax with `bash -n script.sh`

### Common Modification Patterns
- **Adding flatpaks**: Edit `flatpaks/system-flatpaks*.list`, add one per line with comments
- **ISO configuration**: Modify scripts in `iso_files/` - test via workflow dispatch
- **Workflow changes**: Test in your fork first, use workflow dispatch
- **Build logic**: Edit `Justfile` carefully - ensure Just syntax is valid

### Testing ISO Changes
1. **Flatpak changes**: Automatic validation in PR via workflow
2. **ISO configuration**: Trigger workflow dispatch to build test ISO
3. **Workflow changes**: Test in fork before opening PR
4. **Local testing**: Use `just build-iso-ghcr` to avoid building base image
